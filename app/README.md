# Idea
Web application that allows users to create and log into accounts, make posts about rc airplane acquisitions and flight while tagging the model or field, and browse a library of plane models and airfields.

### MVP
- Account creation/login
- Users can create posts to be viewed by others
- Users can comment on posts
- Option to ‘tag’ the model of plane and the airfield
- Tagged airfields and plane models will be added in a database if they do not already exist which is displayed for members to explore
- Model airplanes from database can be saved to a wishlist individual to each user

### Database
- User info
- Posts
- Model airplane info
- Airfield info
- Wishlist
